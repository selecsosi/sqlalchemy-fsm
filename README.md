Finite state machine field for sqlalchemy
==============================================================

sqlalchemy-fsm adds declarative states management for sqlalchemy models.
Instead of adding some state field to a model, and manage its
values by hand, you could use FSMState field and mark model methods
with the `transition` decorator. Your method will contain the side-effects
of the state change.

The decorator also takes a list of conditions, all of which must be met
before a transition is allowed.

Usage
-----

Add FSMState field to you model
    from sqlalchemy_fsm import FSMField, transition

    class BlogPost(db.Model):
        state = db.Column(FSMField, nullable = False)


Use the `transition` decorator to annotate model methods

    @transition(source='new', target='published')
    def published(self):
        """
        This function may contain side-effects, 
        like updating caches, notifying users, etc.
        The return value will be discarded.
        """

`source` parameter accepts a list of states, or an individual state.
You can use `*` for source, to allow switching to `target` from any state.

`@transition`- annotated methods have the following API:
1. `<SqlAlchemy table class>.method()` - returns an SqlAlchemy filter condition that can be used for querying the database (e.g. `session.query(BlogPost).filter(BlogPost.published())`)
1. `<SqlAlchemy record>.method()` - returns boolean value that tells if this particular record is in the target state for that method() (e.g. `if not blog.published():`)
1. `<SqlAlchemy record>.method.set(*args, **kwargs)` - changes the state of the record object to the transitions' target state (or raises an exception if it is not able to do so)
1. `<SqlAlchemy record>.method.can_proceed(*args, **kwargs)` - returns `True` if calling `.method.set(*args, **kwargs)` (with same `*args, **kwargs`) should succeed.

You can also use `None` as source state for (e.g. in case when the state column in nullable).
However, it is _not possible_ to create transition with `None` as target state due to religious reasons.

Transition can be also used on a class object to create a group of handlers
for same target state.

    @transition(target='published')
    class PublishHandler(object):

        @transition(source='new')
        def do_one(self, instance, value):
            instance.side_effect = "published from new"

        @transition(source='draft')
        def do_two(self, instance, value):
            instance.side_effect = "published from draft"


    class BlogPost(db.Model):
        ...
        published = PublishHandler

The transition is still to be invoked by calling the model's `published.set()` method.

An alternative inline class syntax is supported too:

    @transition(target='published')
    class published(object):

        @transition(source='new')
        def do_one(self, instance, value):
            instance.side_effect = "published from new"

        @transition(source='draft')
        def do_two(self, instance, value):
            instance.side_effect = "published from draft"

If calling `published.set()` succeeds without raising an exception, the state field
will be changed, but not written to the database.

    def publish_view(request, post_id):
        post = get_object__or_404(BlogPost, pk=post_id)
        if not post.published.can_proceed():
             raise Http404;

        post.published.set()
        post.save()
        return redirect('/')


If your given function requires arguments to validate, you need to include them
when calling `can_proceed` as well as including them when you call the function
normally. Say `publish.set()` required a date for some reason:

    if not post.published.can_proceed(the_date):
        raise Http404
    else:
        post.publish(the_date)

If your code needs to know the state model is currently in, you can just call
the main function function.

    if post.deleted():
        raise Http404

If you require some conditions to be met before changing state, use the
`conditions` argument to `transition`. `conditions` must be a list of functions
that take one argument, the model instance.  The function must return either
`True` or `False` or a value that evaluates to `True` or `False`. If all
functions return `True`, all conditions are considered to be met and transition
is allowed to happen. If one of the functions return `False`, the transition
will not happen. These functions should not have any side effects.

You can use ordinary functions

    def can_publish(instance):
        # No publishing after 17 hours
        if datetime.datetime.now().hour > 17:
           return False
        return True

Or model methods

    def can_destroy(self):
        return not self.is_under_investigation()

Use the conditions like this:

    @transition(source='new', target='published', conditions=[can_publish])
    def publish(self):
        """
        Side effects galore
        """

    @transition(source='*', target='destroyed', conditions=[can_destroy])
    def destroy(self):
        """
        Side effects galore
        """

You can also use FSM handlers to query the database. E.g.

    session.query(BlogCls).filter(BlogCls.publish())

will return all "Blog" objects whose current state matches "publish"'es target state.

Events
------

Sqlalchemy-fsm integrates with sqlalchemy's event system.
The library exposes two events `before_state_change` and `after_state_change` that are fired up
at the expected points of state's lifecycle.

You can subscribe event listeners via standard SQLAlchemy interface of
`listens_for` or `listen`.

    from sqlalchemy.event import listens_for

    @listens_for(Blog, 'before_state_change')
    def on_state_change(instance, source, target):
        ...

Or

    from sqlalchemy import event

    def on_state_change(instance, source, target):
        ...

    event.listen(Blog, 'after_state_change', on_state_change)


It is possible to de-register an event listener call with `sqlalchemy.event.remove()` method.

How does sqlalchemy-fsm diverge from django-fsm?
------------------------------------------------

* Can't commit data from within transition-decorated functions

* Does support arguments to conditions functions
